Description and instructions:
https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/fa21/materials/proj/proj3/index.html

In this project, I implemented a version-control system that mimics various basic features of the popular system Git. I constructed a serializable file sytem that has a detailed and consumer-oriented error management system. 

Not for use for currently enrolled students.
